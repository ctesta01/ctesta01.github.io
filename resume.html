                <li><h2>Work Experience</h2>
                    <p>I've worked at HostGator, the Tufts Office of Institutional Research, and the Journal of Medical Insight.</p></li>
                <li><h2>Skills</h2>
                    <p>I've been working primarily on JavaScript proficiency recently, but I'm also very adept with several other programming languages. To list a few: Bash, LaTeX, Python, C, R, SPSS, and a few others. I'm hoping that sometime soon I can learn even more Python, and that I will feel comfortable appending JavaScript to that list.</p></li>
                <li><h2>Hobbies</h2>
                    <p>I speak Japanese, and have been in the process of learning the language for 7 years now. I also do craft cocktail bartending, and really enjoy any culinary challenges that are tossed my way.</p></li>
                <li><h2>Education</h2>
                    <p>I'm currently a third year student at Tufts university, majoring in mathematics and computer science, with a minor in Japanese studies. I attended LASA H.S. in Austin, TX. I'm hoping some day I'll consider this a small percentage of my education background.</p></li>
