My experience is vast and varied. In 2017, I am graduating from Tufts
culminating with a Seniors Honors Thesis on Elliptic Curves, the subject
of one my first posts. I have focused on subjects like Web Engineering,
Abstract Algebra, High Performance Computing, and Data Analysis.
In the past, I have worked for HostGator on Linux
and Apache web stacks. At the Tufts Office of Institutional Research
with R building web apps automating processing Qualtrics survey data.
For the Journal of Medical Insight I worked on *"Docker-izing"* a
Django rebuild of their website. I dream of architecting combinations
of Mathematics and Technology, empowering more people to appreciate the
beauty of theory, while harnessing the power of the web as a medium.

My interests include Number Theory, Web Engineering, and Data Visualization.
