I want to use mathematics and statistics in socially responsible
scientific research to achieve a positive impact on the lives of others.
Subjects such as environmental science, public health, and the economics of
wealth inequality motivate me to become more skillful at mathematics and
effective communication.

My interests include: 

- Coffee
- Craft Cocktails
- Dance
- Data Journalism
- Data Visualization
- Expository Writing
- Learning Languages
- Mathematical Modeling
- Origami
- Teaching
- Photography
- Programming
- Public Health
- Pure Mathematics
