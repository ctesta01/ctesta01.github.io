<p>Elliptic curves are a subject, simple to construct and ubiquitous, that have found
themselves at the forefront of Number Theory and Algebraic Geometry research.
The subject has roots in some of the oldest Mathematics, and its modern
connections tie it to an incredible span of research including
fluid flow, sphere packing, modular forms, and string theory. Elliptic curves
are the degree three nonsingular algebraic plane curves with at least one
rational point.</p>

<p><img src="http://ctesta.com/img/2017-03-05/three-example-curves.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Their existence was considered by Diophantus in the 2nd century a.d. in
his text Arithmetica. The question he originally posed has been rephrased
in modern language: “To divide a given number into two numbers such that their
product is a cube minus its side.” That is, given $a \in \mathbb N$ find
$x,y \in \mathbb Z$ such that
<script type="math/tex">y(a-y) = x^3 - x.</script></p>

<p>Most individuals are familiar with the plane conics, the degree
two nonsingular algebraic curves. Elliptic curves, in some sense,
are their slightly more complicated, yet seemingly infinitely more subtle,
older sibling.</p>

<p>Elliptic curves are contemporarily thought of as plane curves,
however they originally arose in the context of calculating arc-lengths
of ellipses. It is these arc-lengths
of ellipses which in part created elliptic curve’s early ubiquity.
These are the elliptic functions.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\int \frac{d\theta}{\sqrt{C + \cos \theta}} =
- \int \frac{dx}{\sqrt{(1-x^2)(C+x)}} =
\int \frac{dx}{y}, \text{ where } y^2 = (1-x^2)(C+x).</script>

<p>Apollonius first considered calculating the arc-length of an ellipse
around 200 b.c. and found that he was unable to do it. This problem
defied progress until the 17th century when Euler and others found
infinite series expressions for arc-lengths. Further, Euler discovered
as surprising group law for these infinite series.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\int_{\infty}^{x_1} \frac{dx}{y} + \int_{\infty}^{x_2} \frac{dx}{y} =
\int_{\infty}^{x_3} \frac{dx}{y}.</script>

<p>Elliptic functions, before connecting to elliptic curves,
were inverted and considered as elliptic integrals by mathematicians such
as Abel, Gauss, Jacobi, and notably Weierstraß. The motivation for doing
so is that the inverse of $\int \frac{dx}{\sqrt{1-x^2}} = \arcsin(x)$
is significantly more friendly a function.</p>

<p>While it may be that Diophantus considered solutions to the equation
describing an elliptic curve, their modern formulation rests on their
analytic construction as the doubly periodic functions over $\mathbb C$.
These are Weierstraß’ elliptic functions</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\wp:\mathbb C \to \mathbb C / \Lambda \text{ for some } \Lambda \cong
\mathbb Z\omega_1 +\mathbb Z\omega_2,</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\wp(z) = \frac{1}{z^2} + \sum_{\omega \in \Lambda - \{ 0\} } \left( \frac{1}{(z-\omega)^2} -\frac{1}{\omega}^2 \right).</script>
