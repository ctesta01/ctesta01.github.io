Okay, so what is it that would be useful to say about a mathematical topic which I am
totally new to? 

- Introductory reference material links
- What are the major theorems? 
- Are there some cool visualizations I can make
  - What about parameterizations of a Klein bottle.


Introductory Material

- [Math.StackExchange on the Best Topology Books](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/7520/best-book-for-topology)
- [Topology without Tears book](http://www.topologywithouttears.net/topbook.pdf)
- [Allen Hatcher’s Recommendations for Learning Topology](https://www.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/Other/topologybooks.pdf)
- [Allen Hatcher’s Topology Notes](http://www.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/Top/TopNotes.pdf)


I also really like Klaus Janich's writing style, but I have yet to really get
into his topology book. 

I'll go read what I can in Janich's Topology and Hatcher's introductory notes
now before doing anything else.
