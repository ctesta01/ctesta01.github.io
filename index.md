# Welcome to my blog.

This is my blog, hosted through GitHub pages using Ruby's Jekyll static-site generator. 
I do photography, ballroom dance, mathematics, data science, programming, 
craft cocktail making, and bicycling. I want to use mathematics and data science to 
work in socially responsible scientific research and industries such as 
environmental science, public health, privacy advocacy, and 
the economics of wealth inequality and poverty. My academic background heavily focuses 
on both theoretical and applied mathematics, including subjects such as high performance 
computing, data analysis, numerical linear algebra, number theory, abstract algebra, and 
plenty more. I hope you will find enjoyable content on my website, and feel free to leave
a comment letting me know you dropped by.
