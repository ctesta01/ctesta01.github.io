## Christian Testa

I am a statistical data analyst at the [Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public
Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/) working with the [Public Health
Disparities Geocoding
Project](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/thegeocodingproject/). I
received my Bachelors of Science in Mathematics from Tufts University in 2017.


### Research Interests

My research interests focus on mathematical modeling techniques and their
public health applications. 

Techniques I have been working with recently include:

- Causal inference 
- Bayesian methods
- Spatial statistics
- Model selection
- Differential equations modeling

My recent work has focused on applying these techniques to understand
disparities in COVID-19 outcomes, how discrimination throughout the lifecourse
is manifested through changes in epigenetic markers as it relates to epigenetic
aging, and how experiences of multifactorial types of discrimination impact
people's health.

My previous work with the [Prevention Policy Modeling Lab](https://ppml.stanford.edu/) 
focused on using dynamic models of infectious diseases to estimate optimal 
intervention strategies.
