A few years ago I took a course from [Sauro
Succi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauro_Succi) called *Computational
Methods for the Physical Sciences* that surveyed topics such as computational
methods for computationally solving partial differential equations, methods for
simulating physical systems where processes span different scales of magnitude
such as in turbulence or fracturing materials, and statistical physics.
Arguably the most interesting feature of the course was the [Lattice-Boltzmann
method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_Boltzmann_methods) for fluid
dynamics that has particular advantages in its amenability to parallelization
and efficiency.

Throughout this course I created a handful of visualizations that, looking back on,
seem worth sharing. The first of which, depicted above, shows a normally
distributed mass shifting across periodic boundaries on the left and right hand
sides as it slowly diffuses and spreads out.  There's nothing deep about this,
I just thought the visualization looks nice. 

![A rectangular distribution of mass is shown in multiple iterations where the
edges start to rapidly oscillate due to Gibbs phenomenon in a way that doesn't
reflect what would really happen in reality (the rectangle would just move to
the side).](/img/2021-03-20/gibbs-phenomena.png)

One of the concepts introduced in this course was [Gibbs phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbs_phenomenon)
which is what happens in a variety of contexts, the most popular of which being 
when one either attempts to approximate a square distribution through Fourier 
decomposition, or when one attempts to propogate a square distribution of mass 
over a discretized model of space. The result is that when the movement does not 
exactly line up with the discretization of space, the approximation of how much 
mass is at each discrete point in space can go quite haywire. 

![A normal distribution is shown "puffing up" after each iteration, eventually
appearing as though it has puffed up against an upper limit past which it
cannot puff anymore](/img/2021-03-20/reaction-with-carrying-capacity.png)

This is a visualization of some material which can be thought of as reacting
with itself in a way that produces more of itself (not realistic, I know) up to 
the observed carrying capacity. Again, nothing profound, just an aesthetically 
pleasing visualization. 

For my final project in this course, I worked on a spatial model of infectious
disease transmission with stochasticity and reinfection. I think infectious
disease modeling is a fascinating subject and I'm suspicious it's worth thinking 
through the intricacies of how stochasticity can affect disease dynamics in ways
that deterministic equations might not reveal.

![A 2D grid is shown where initially there is only a spike at the center. The areas concentrically 
around the center begin to spike in a noisy fashion as disease transmission is simulated to reach 
neighboring patches of the grid. A ring of spikes continue to propagate outwards, while the center 
equilibriates to a low level of noisy activity.](/img/2021-03-20/2D SIRS with noise.gif)
