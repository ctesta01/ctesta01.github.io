Knowledge is the Great Equalizer. And when we live in a time of great
wealth inequality, I believe mathematics is a way forward to empower those
who have found themselves as underdogs. Whether it is for personal need,
for a job, for money, or for a grand cause, to find beauty and elegance in
the world, mathematics is meant to be shared and enjoyed by many.
Individuals may approach mathematics from different perspectives,
motivations, and mindsets, and regardless, mathematics strengthens
and mystifies those who consume it. It is my hope that among these
links readers will find interesting ideas and useful directions for their
own personal benefit.

- "A mathematician is a device for turning coffee into theorems."
- "God may not play dice with the universe, but something strange
is going on with the prime numbers."
- "It is not enough to be in the right place at the right time.
You should also have an open mind at the right time."

## Communities

One of the most important components of truly engaging with mathematics is
to find others to engage with mathematics together.

- [Math Reddit](https://reddit.com/r/math)
- [Math.StackExchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/)
- [MathOverflow](https://mathoverflow.net/)
- [Numberphile Videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/numberphile)

## Online Articles, Discussions, and Places of Wonder

These links provide a seemingly infinite amount of mathematical content.
I recommend losing yourself in them.

- [Quanta Magazine's Math Section](https://www.quantamagazine.org/tag/mathematics/)
- [Math.StackExchange ordered by Votes](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions?sort=votes)
- [MathOverflow sorted by Votes](https://mathoverflow.net/questions?sort=votes)
- [Elementary Short and Useful Proofs from MathOverflow](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/60457/elementaryshortuseful)
- Wikipedia
    - [Outline of Mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_mathematics)
    - [List of Mathematical Topics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_mathematics_topics)
    - [Areas of Mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Areas_of_mathematics)
    - [Glossary of Areas of Mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_areas_of_mathematics)
    - [Mathematics Subject Classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics_Subject_Classification#First-level_areas)

## Blogs and Websites

These are websites and blogs I find enlightening and entertaining.

- [How to Become a Pure Mathematician](http://hbpms.blogspot.com/)
- [Math âˆ© Programming](https://jeremykun.com/)
- [Terence Tao's What's New](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/)

## Learning Material

Learning mathematics requires time, effort, and resources. Of course
mathematical content is available in books, in journals, and from professionals.
However, Sci-Hub and other book-sharing projects like LibGen and BookZZ
exist to help freely spread information and can be used at the reader's
discretion. Promisingly, open source books are beginning to become popular
in mathematics. Time and Energy are not cheap, but if the cost of the information
can be free, perhaps many more will be able to appreciate the beauty of mathematics.

It is my hope that by aggregating this content and material, the barrier of
entry into mathematics is (perhaps by some $\epsilon > 0$) slightly lowered.
