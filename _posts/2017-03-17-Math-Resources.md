Please, enjoy mathematics as I have. The following are many links and resources which 
I have found useful as well as inspiring. 


- "A mathematician is a device for turning coffee into theorems." -Alfréd Rényi
- "God may not play dice with the universe, but something strange
is going on with the prime numbers." -Carl Pomerance
- "It is not enough to be in the right place at the right time.
You should also have an open mind at the right time." -Paul Erdős

## Communities

One of the most important components of truly engaging with mathematics is
to find others to engage with mathematics together.

- [Math Reddit](https://reddit.com/r/math)
- [Math.StackExchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/)
- [MathOverflow](https://mathoverflow.net/)
- [Numberphile Videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/numberphile)

## Online Articles, Discussions, and Places of Wonder

These links provide a seemingly infinite amount of mathematical content.
I recommend losing yourself in them.

## Learning Material

Learning mathematics requires time, effort, and resources. Of course
mathematical content is available in books, in journals, and from professionals.
However, Sci-Hub and other book-sharing projects like LibGen and BookZZ
exist to help freely spread information and can be used at the reader's
discretion. Promisingly, open source books are beginning to become popular
in mathematics. Time and Energy are not cheap, but if the cost of the information
can be free, perhaps many more will be able to appreciate the beauty of mathematics.

It is my hope that by aggregating this content and material, the barrier of
entry into mathematics is (perhaps by some $\epsilon > 0$) slightly lowered.
