<p>I am writing here to encourage you to enjoy mathematics, to appreciate its beauty, 
and recognize its incredible potential in application. The following are many links and resources which 
I have found useful as well as inspiring. 
Subjects which have the same profundity and beauty as mathematics are few and far between, 
and to allow others to miss out on the humbling and world-expanding experiences available in the world 
of mathematics would be a regret of mine for a long time to come.</p>

is going on with the prime numbers.” -Carl Pomerance</li>
  <li>“A mathematician is a device for turning coffee into theorems.” -Alfréd Rényi</li>
  <li>“It is not enough to be in the right place at the right time.
You should also have an open mind at the right time.” -Paul Erdős</li>

to find others to engage with mathematics together.</p>

<h2 id="learning-material">Learning Material</h2>

<p>Learning mathematics requires time, effort, and resources. Of course
mathematical content is available in books, in journals, and from professionals.
However, Sci-Hub and other book-sharing projects like LibGen and BookZZ
exist to help freely spread information and can be used at the reader’s
discretion. Promisingly, open source books are beginning to become popular
in mathematics. Time and Energy are not cheap, but if the cost of the information
can be free, perhaps many more will be able to appreciate the beauty of mathematics.</p>

<p>It is my hope that by aggregating this content and material, the barrier of
entry into mathematics is (perhaps by some $\epsilon &gt; 0$) slightly lowered.</p>
