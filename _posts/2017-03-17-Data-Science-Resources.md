Data Science is the future. As humans become more technologically
sophisticated, there is simply more data with more precision and with
more meaning to be uncovered. Statistics, linear algebra, and algorithms
have coalesced in the subject of data science, and its appeal stretches
across amazingly diverse domains. In science, there is observation,
conjecture, and proof. And Data Science has fundamentally sharpened
the modern researcher's observational step.

## R

I have enjoyed working in R, despite its quirkiness as a language. The
libraries ggplot2, dplyr, htmltools, and d3 integrations make developing
in R an exciting experience. At the R console raw data can be transformed in
moments into rich visualizations, and this has always made R exciting for me.

## Python

Python is ubiquitous, writing Python feels natural, its community
has written packages for anything and everything.
The quality of research enabled by Jupyter notebooks and the speed
data can be processed at in parallel makes Python a powerful skill
to have in one's pocket. Access to these high precision and powerful tools
creates new opportunity for both more subtle and more
computationally intensive projects.
