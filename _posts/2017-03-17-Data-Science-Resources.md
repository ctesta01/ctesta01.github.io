## R

I have absolutely enjoyed working in R. The
libraries ggplot2, dplyr, htmltools, and d3 integrations make developing
data-viz in R an exciting experience. 
At the R console raw data can be transformed in
moments into rich visualizations, and this always makes R exciting for me.

## Python

Python is ubiquitous, writing Python feels natural, and its community
has written packages for anything and everything.
The quality of reproducible research enabled by Jupyter notebooks and the speed
of Python in parallel makes Python a powerful skill
to have in one's pocket. Increased access to such incredibly performant tools
like Python is always creating new opportunites for more subtle and more
computationally intensive projects.
