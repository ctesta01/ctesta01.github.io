This is a bit of a best of 2019 post. 

<!--more-->

I'm engaged now; I really couldn't be happier about this one! 

My [paper on gonorrhea in Baltimore and San
Francisco](https://journals.lww.com/stdjournal/Abstract/publishahead/The_potential_population_level_impact_of_different.98009.aspx)
was published this last December. It's exciting to have
my first paper and to be one of two co-first authors on it. 

The web application I've been developing at work,
[Tabby2](https://ppmltools.org/tabby2) passed the [Center for Disease Control
and Prevention](https://cdc.gov)'s Scientific Web Tool Clearance and is now
live online for public access! 

Another collaborator and I have submitted our paper on syphilis in Louisiana 
and Massachusetts to the CDC for clearance and will be heading to journals 
soon to publish. 

I've had two amazing trips to Colorado this year; My fianc√©e and I went to
visit my grandparents in Denver and got to see some of the lovely national
parks near there, and my dad, his girlfriend, and I went camping near Gunnison
National Forest. 

My dad is working on his food truck and it brings me great joy to see his 
progress as he makes his dream a reality.

My friends all seem to be doing well -- It's incredibly inspiring to see my
friends enjoying themselves and doing brilliant things in all kinds of
different ways and places. 

I'm really pleased with 2019. It was a year that I put a lot of work in and got
a lot out of it. But I also feel that it was a year that I became more
confident in myself.

Of my new years goals, the one I want to mention here is that I'm aiming to
improve my technical writing skills by reading five books on statistics and
machine learning and publishing problem sets or write-ups about them and their
topics here this semester. Please feel free to ask about the details in the
comments! 

Thanks for reading; hopefully posts will become more frequent here.
