message: "Hi Alex, \r\n\r\nI really wish I could provide you a more thorough answer that could elucidate some of the intuitions, but I'm really very much a novice in this area.  My hunch is that if you wanted to understand how the geometry of PSL(2,Z) and the number theoretic properties of elliptic curves relate, I would dig into the literature on the [J-invariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J-invariant). It would also be good to look into [Complex Multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_multiplication). \r\n\r\n-Testa"
