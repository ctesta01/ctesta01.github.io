  Elliptic curves are much more familiar to me from an analytic/geometric
  perspective. Is there a way of getting an intuition for the number-theoretic
  properties of these special functions through the geometry of the moduli space
  of complex tori, e.g. through the geometry of how PSL(2, R) acts on the upper
  half-plane?
