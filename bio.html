        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> I am Christian Testa, a current student at Tufts University in Mathematics and Computer Science. I’m on track to pursue a PhD in mathematics, and working towards studying Number Theory. I have worked at HostGator.com on two separate occasions and enjoy working on my linux system administration skills in my free time.<br><br> While attending Tufts, I’m working at the Tufts Office of Institutional Research and Evaluation as a research assistant. The office works primarily to publish statistical reports quantifying the ranking of Tufts’ and its student population against other comparable schools. The work I do there has influenced me to consider pursuing further work or possibly a career in data science.<br><br> I’m looking for opportunities to work on interesting projects, especially in fields related to math, linux system administration, data science, or web engineering. Please feel free to contact me if you’d like to suggest one.
